# What's This For?

Programming for FTC requires a working knowledge of Java. To help us practice we write programs within the [RoboCode](robocode.sourceforge.net).
 
## Getting Started
As we know, setup can be tricky...but guess what...there is a video to help you:

We're all going to use the same version:
 GOTO: https://sourceforge.net/projects/robocode/files/robocode/1.9.2.5/
 Download: robocode-1.9.2.5-setup.jar


It's pretty well documented:

But if you have questions, or need additional explanation, please don't hesitate to ask me, or your teammates.


I would suggest just copy, paste this example code for your first bot, to just see how the game works and how to run bots in the ring.
